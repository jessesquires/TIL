#### Tip: mark a workaround for a bug as deprecated in next compiler version, [@olebegemann](https://twitter.com/olebegemann/status/1294583027583123458):

> If you write a workaround for a bug, mark it as deprecated in the next compiler version to get a timely reminder to check if the bug has been fixed. If it has, delete the workaround. If it hasn’t, update the deprecation to the next version.
