> Data Protection is an iOS feature that is automatically enabled the moment a passcode is set on the device. As this is enabled automatically, you get a lot of encryption support for free on your apps. You do not need to do anything especial when reading and writing files to ensure they are protected by Data Protection. Instead, you just use all reading and writing APIs as you would normally do, and the system will take care of encryption on the fly for you. This process is automatic, and when available, they use hardware-accelerated features.
