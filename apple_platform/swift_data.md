#### [SwiftData Saving Changes](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/swiftdata-saving-changes/)

> One difference from Core Data is that SwiftData will save a changed context automatically. Anytime you insert a new object, change, or delete an object the context needs saving.

#### [SwiftData: Store Image Data, but Actually Outside the Database - Christian Tietze](https://christiantietze.de/posts/2023/08/swiftdata-store-image-data-outside-the-database/)

> SwiftData models can manage storage outside to the database.

#### [SwiftData Background Tasks](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/swiftdata-background-tasks/)

> How do you perform a SwiftData operation in the background?

#### [SwiftData Fetching An Existing Object](https://useyourloaf.com/blog/swiftdata-fetching-an-existing-object/)

> How do you find an existing SwiftData model object from its persistent model identifier?

#### [Making your SwiftData models Codable – Donny Wals](https://www.donnywals.com/making-your-swiftdata-models-codable/)

> With SwiftData it's so much easier to define model objects so it makes sense to take a look at making SwiftData models `Codable` to see if it's better than Core Data.
