## Receipt Validation

For subscriptions and IAPs, often folks implement server-side receipt validation, but that is not _always_ necessary. It is possible to do receipt validation 100% clide-side, which might make sense in some cases. For example, simple client-side gating for client-side features. If subscriptions or IAPs access server content or services, _then_ you should definitely validate receipts on the server.

Be aware that client-side validation is susceptible to being undermined by hacks and jailbreaks. However, this may not be a concern for you.

> That code will work fine until you encounter a customer that has Family Sharing enabled, as most do. The issue is that the Product.SubscriptionInfo can contain multiple items, and the code above only checks the first one.

## Subscription Management

#### [Curtis Herbert](https://x.com/parrots/status/1250828059776880640)

> Came up twice today, so PSA:
>
> If you have an iOS subscription-based app, you can UIApp.openURL "https://finance-app.itunes.apple.com/account/subscriptions” to pop the user right to the sub management screen.
>
> I argue you have a moral obligation to have a "manage sub" button in your app that does just that.
